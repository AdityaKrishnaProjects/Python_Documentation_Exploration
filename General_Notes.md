#### Preface

This file will serve as my general notes on the python documentation. The headings of this markdown file will correspond to the different chapters in the table of contents for Python Documentation as of September 2024, starting on Module 4. Within this note I will reference the modules and experiments I did with them, the code for these modules I experimented with and the results of these experiments will be housed in the modules folder.

##### Module 4 - More Control Flow Tools

```
function test() {
  console.log("notice the blank line before this function?");
}
