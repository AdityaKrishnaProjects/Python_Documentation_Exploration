#### Preface

This file will serve as my general notes on the python documentation. The headings of this markdown file will correspond to the different chapters in the table of contents for Python Documentation as of September 2024, starting on Module 3. Within this note I will reference the modules and experiments I did with them, the code for these modules I experimented with and the results of these experiments will be housed in the modules folder.

##### Module 3 - An Informal Introduction to Python

__Basics__

In python everything is an object. When we declare a variable, we are really binding a name to an object. From then on this name will be used to refer to this object. 

__Experiments with names and binding__

Names and binding is a bit strange, so some experiments with basic data types should make it a bit clearer: 

```
# Experiments with names and binding

# We expect this to cause a to be 1, and b to be 3, as the first line binds the object 1 to a,
# and then we bind the object named by a to b, and then we bind 3 to b.
a = 1
b = a
b = 3

print("b = ", b)
print("a = ", a)

# We expect this to cause both lists to be identical: [2,2,3]
first_List = [1,2,3]
second_List = first_List
second_List[0] = 2

print("second list =", second_List)
print("first list =", first_List)

# We expect this to cause two different lists
third_List = [1,2,3]
fourth_List = third_List
fourth_List = [3,2,1]

print("fourth list =", fourth_List)
print("third list =", third_List)

# We get what we expect!
```

We see the way this works is intuitive! When we declare a variable, we start reading from the right where the object is created, and then we get the object bound to a list. For examples 1 and 3, there is nothing to explain, as new objects are created and then names are bound to them. For example 2, we see that fourth_List is bound to third_List, which is an object we have already declared. Then when we edit fourth_List we are editing the object named by both third_List and fourth_List! 

__Strings and basic string functions__

Strings are stored as lists, and so you can reference their entries as you would in a list. Strings are immutable so you can not edit them like normal lists. 

__Splicing__

This works by taking the name binded to the object created and then applying [] with indices to this name. Example: 

```
# Messing around with string splicing, and strings

test_String = "blobalob"

# This string is 8 characters long, so the list should have entried indexed from 0 to 7
# We then can think about splcing the string as having the left of the first 'b' be index 0
# and the right of the last 'b' be index 8. The heuristic for splicing is that the final 
# piece of the index is always omitted, whereas the first element of the heursitic is always included
# So even though the list's final index is 7, for splicing we will use 8 as the final index to get 
# the end of the string. 

# We expect this to be the string "alob" because it starts at index 4, which is right after the fourth character
print(test_String[4:8])

# We expect this to be the string blob, as it ends at index 4, which is character 5

print(test_String[:4])

# We then have splicing tools, we can end the splice or start the splice with an empty character to get
# the end or the start of the string. We can also use negative entries of the string

# This should produce the same result as above
print(test_String[4:])

# As should this
print(test_String[-4:])

# And this should produce the string
print(test_String[:4] + test_String[4:])
```

We see a couple things here, strings are stored as lists of characters as we know, and therefore when we splice with them we respected the indices the list data type gives us (starts at 0 and ends at n-1 of the number of items in the list). We can then think of the string as being split up with 0 being to the left of the first character and n being to the right of the last character when we use splices which always include the first index but exclude the final index. 

We also have negative indices for strings, which start at -n to the left of the first character and end at -1 to the left of the final character. 

We also have an empty splice, which to the left gives the first character and to the right gives the last character. 

##### Module 4 - More Control Flow Tools

__if Statements__

```
x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))

if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
    print('Single')
else:
    print('More')
```

elif is used in place of doing an else and then an indented if after if statements to avoid excessive indentation statements with further if statments.

__for Statements__

__Seeing how for loops over strings works__

```
test_String = "string"

for letter in test_String:
   print(letter, len(letter))
```

output: 
```
s 1
t 1
r 1
i 1
n 1
g 1
```

Length of each character was 1 which we would expect, and the loop iterates over each character in the string.
