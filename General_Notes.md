#### Preface

This file will serve as my general notes on the python documentation. The headings of this markdown file will correspond to the different chapters in the table of contents for Python Documentation as of September 2024, starting on Module 3. Within this note I will reference the modules and experiments I did with them, the code for these modules I experimented with and the results of these experiments will be housed in the modules folder.

##### Module 3 - An Informal Introduction to Python

__Basics__

In python everything is an object. When we declare a variable, we are really binding a name to an object. From then on this name will be used to refer to this object. 

__Strings and basic string functions__

Strings are stored as lists, and so you can reference their entries. Strings are immutable so you can not edit them like normal lists. 

__Splicing__

This works by taking the name binded to the object created and then applying [] with indices to this name. Example: 

```
# Messing around with string splicing, and strings

test_String = "blobalob"

# This string is 8 characters long, so the list should have entried indexed from 0 to 7
# We then can think about splcing the string as having the left of the first 'b' be index 0
# and the right of the last 'b' be index 8. The heuristic for splicing is that the final 
# piece of the index is always omitted, whereas the first element of the heursitic is always included
# So even though the list's final index is 7, for splicing we will use 8 as the final index to get 
# the end of the string. 

# We expect this to be the string "alob" because it starts at index 4, which is right after the fourth character
print(test_String[4:8])

# We expect this to be the string blob, as it ends at index 4, which is character 5

print(test_String[:4])

# We then have splicing tools, we can end the splice or start the splice with an empty character to get
# the end or the start of the string. We can also use negative entries of the string

# This should produce the same result as above
print(test_String[4:])

# As should this
print(test_String[-4:])

# And this should produce the string
print(test_String[:4] + test_String[4:])
```



##### Module 4 - More Control Flow Tools

__if Statements__

```
x = int(input("Please enter an integer: "))

if x < 0:
    x = 0
    print('Negative changed to zero')
elif x == 0:
    print('Zero')
elif x == 1:
    print('Single')
else:
    print('More')
```

elif is used in place of doing an else and then an indented if after if statements to avoid excessive indentation statements with further if statments.

__for Statements__

__Seeing how for loops over strings works__

```
test_String = "string"

for letter in test_String:
   print(letter, len(letter))
```

output: 
```
s 1
t 1
r 1
i 1
n 1
g 1
```

Length of each character was 1 which we would expect, and the loop iterates over each character in the string.
